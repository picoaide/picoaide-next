-- 0016: skill/mcp grants (admin-authorized usage, strict default).
-- Subjects are usernames or group names (grantee_type disambiguates);
-- groups are resolved via the groups/user_groups tables at query time,
-- so revoking a grant (or LDAP group membership) takes effect immediately.
-- Admins are implicitly allowed everywhere and never need a grant row.
